/*Write a program that reads in an integer N from the keyboard, and displays
whether N is a "perfect number" or not. A number is "perfect" if it is equal 
to the sum of all of its factors (not including itself as a factor, but
including 1 as a factor). 6 is the first perfect number, because its factors
are 1, 2, and 3, and 1+2+3 = 6.
 
Add a loop to your program to find the next perfect number after 6. */
