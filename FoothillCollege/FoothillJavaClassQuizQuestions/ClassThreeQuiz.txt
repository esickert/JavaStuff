1)Write a program that reads in an int from the keyboard and prints a message saying whether it is positive or negative.

2)
Write a program that reads in an int from the keyboard, and stores the int in a variable x.
Then write a loop that prints "Hello, world!" to the screen x times.

3) Write some code to read in an integer, and print ALL of the factors of that number.

4)

Code Sample One 											Code Sample Two
													count = 1;
for (int count = 1; count <= n; count++) {			while (count <= n) {
	System.out.println(count);count = 1;			System.out.println(count);
 														count++;
}													}


 
Correct 	A. 	Sample One and Two are exactly equivalent for all input values of n.
 
			B. 	Sample One and Two are exactly equivalent for all input values of n >=1, but differ when n<=0.
 
			C. 	Sample One and Two are exactly equivalent only when n = 0.
 
			D. 	Sample One and Two are exactly equivalent only when n is even.
 
			E. 	Sample One and Two are not equivalent for any input values of n.


5)
//pre-condition: n>0

//post-condition: returns n with its digits reversed

//Example: if n=234, method reverse returns 432

 

A. 	for(int i =0; i <= n; i++) {

     rem = i % 10;

     revNum = revNum * 10 + rem;

	}
 
B. 	for(int i =0; i <= n; i++) {

     rem = n % 10;

     revNum = revNum * 10 + rem;

     n/=10;

	}
Missed Correct Answer
C. 	while( n != 0) {

     rem = n%10;

     revNum = revNum * 10 + rem;

     n/=10;

	}
