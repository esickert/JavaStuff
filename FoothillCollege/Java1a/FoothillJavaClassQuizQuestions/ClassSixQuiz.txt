Class 6 Quiz

1) What is wrong with the following code fragment?

    int[] a;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
       a[i] = i * i;

 
Answer

array a has not been initialized
Feedback

It does not allocate memory for a[] with new. The code results in a variable might not have been initialized compile-time error.

2)

What does the following code fragment print?

    int[] a = { 1, 2, 3 };
    int[] b = { 1, 2, 3 };
    System.out.println(a == b);

 
Answer

boolean??   ...true??   WRONG!!!!!!
Feedback

Solution: It prints false. The == operator compares whether the (memory addresses of the) two arrays are identical, not whether their corresponding values are equal.

3)
What is the value of a[1] after the following code is executed?
 

    int[] a = {0, 2, 4, 1, 3};
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++)
         a[i] = a[(a[i] + 3) % a.length];

 
Answer

a[1] = 0   WRONG!!!!!!
Feedback

The value is 1 

4)
What are the values in arr after the following statements are executed?
 

    int[] arr = {1, 1, 0, 0, 0};

    for (int i = 2; i < arr.length; i++)
         arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2];

In your own words, explain what is the difference between a while loop and a do..while loop?
Answer

the do - while loop always executes at least once. It's possible that the while loop will never execute.
Feedback

The difference between do-while and while is that do-while evaluates its expression at the bottom of the loop instead of the top. Therefore, the statements within the do block are always executed at least once, as shown in the following DoWhileDemo program:
