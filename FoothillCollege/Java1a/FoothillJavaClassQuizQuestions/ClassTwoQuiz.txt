At a certain school, students receive letter grades based on the following scale.
Numeric Score  	Letter Grade
93 or above 	A
From 84 to 92 inclusive 	B
From 75 to 83 inclusive 	C
Below 75 	F

Which of the following code segments will assign the correct string to grade for a given integer score?
Option A.
if (score >= 93)
        grade = "A";
if (score >= 84 && score <= 92)
        grade = "B";
if (score >= 75 && score <= 83)
        grade = "C";
if (score < 75)
        grade = "F";
 
Option B:
if (score >= 93)
        grade = "A";
if (84 <=  score <= 92)
        grade = "B";
if (75 <= score <= 83)
        grade = "C";
if (score < 75)
        grade = "F";
 
Option C:
if (score >= 93)
        grade = "A";
else if (score >= 84)
        grade = "B";
else if (score >= 75)
        grade = "C";
else
        grade = "F";

 
 
	A. 	Option B only
 	B. 	Option C only
        C. 	Option A and B only
	D. 	Option A and C only
 	E. 	Options A, B, and C

Answer Key: D

Write a code fragment that prints true if the double variables x and y are both strictly between 0 and 1 and false otherwise.
Answer

if  (x > 0) && (x < 1) && (y > 0) && (y <1)

    System.out.println("true")

else System.out.println("False"

What is wrong with the following code fragment?

double x = -32.2;
boolean isPositive = (x > 0);
if (isPositive = true) 
     System.out.println(x + " is positive");
else                   
     System.out.println(x + " is not positive");
/**************************************************************************
//This is the code imputted into geany

class test  {
    public static void main(String[] args)  {

double x = -32.2;
boolean isPositive = (x > 0);
if (isPositive = true) 
     System.out.println(x + " is positive");
else                   
     System.out.println(x + " is not positive");
}
}

OUTPUT:
-32.2 is positive


Tell me what this code is doing??????

In the assignment statement below, what is the purpose of the (double) used?

 

int x = 3, y = 2;

double z = (double) x / y;
 
	A. 	To double the amount of the answer, like multiplying by 2.
Correct 	B. 	To make sure that the result of the division is a decimal number.
 
	C. 	To round the answer to the nearest integer.
 
	D. 	To round the answer to the nearest tenth.

Suppose that a and b are boolean values.

Show that the expression (!(a && b) && (a || b)) || ((a && b) || !(a || b)) is equivalent to true.
