1. Write a statement (ie line of Java code) which declares a double precision floating point variable and assign it the initial value of 13.8.

2. List at least three primitive data types used in Java.

3. What is the difference between a floating point numbers and integers?

4 Which one of the following code segments will cause an error?
	A. 	
		int x;
		x = 7;
	B. 	double y = 42.8;
	C. 	
		int b;
		int b = 5;
	D. 	
		double a = 7.6;
		a = 54.9;
Answer: C because b was declared earlier.

5.What is main()?
	Answer: main() is a method, which is a collection of statements. It marks the place in the
			  program where execution begins. When the program runs it starts at the first
			  statement in main and ends when it finishes the last statement.

DEF: Library- a library is a collection of class and method definitions 

6. What is the value of x after the following code executes?
	double x = 5.0;
	double z = 1.5;
	x = x ­ 3.9;
	z = x + 2.0;
	x += z;
	x--;
­
­7.	int a = 10;
	int b = 6;
	What is the value of a/b?

8.   Show that the expression (!(a && b) && (a || b)) || ((a && b) || !(a || b)) is equivalent to true.     

9.  ****** Write a static method odd() that takes three boolean inputs and returns true if an odd number of inputs are true, and false otherwise. ********WORK ON!!!!  

10.  Write a code fragment that prints true if the double variables x and y are both strictly between 0 and 1 and false otherwise.   CHECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SEE DoubleNums.java


11.  What is wrong with the following code fragment?  

double x = -32.2;
boolean isPositive = (x > 0);
if (isPositive = true) 
     System.out.println(x + " is positive");
else                   
     System.out.println(x + " is not positive");

Nothing It compiles and runs. The result as written is "-32.2 is positive" tHE ASSIGMENT OPERATOR IN THIS CASE RESULTS WITH TRUE AS A BOOLEAN

12.  
At a certain school, students receive letter grades based on the following scale.

Numeric Score  	Letter Grade
93 or above			 	A
From 84 to 92 inclusive 	B
From 75 to 83 inclusive 	C
Below 75				 	F

Which of the following code segments will assign the correct string to grade for a given integer score?

Option A.
if (score >= 93)
        grade = "A";
if (score >= 84 && score <= 92)
        grade = "B";
if (score >= 75 && score <= 83)
        grade = "C";
if (score < 75)
        grade = "F";
 
Option B:
if (score >= 93)
        grade = "A";
if (84 <=  score <= 92)   ***   these expressions are illegal in java
        grade = "B";
if (75 <= score <= 83)   ***  TestOdd.java:24: error: bad operand types for binary operator '<='
        grade = "C";
if (score < 75)
        grade = "F";
 
Option C:
if (score >= 93)
        grade = "A";
else if (score >= 84)
        grade = "B";
else if (score >= 75)
        grade = "C";
else
        grade = "F";

A and C only !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

13.   What does the following code fragment do for the different values of x (negative, 0, positive)?

    if (x > 0);
        System.out.println("positive");

14.What is the value of a after the following code fragment is executed?

    //*/
    a = 17;
    /*/
    a = -17;
    //*/

15.  What does the following print?

    public static void main(String[] args) { 
       boolean nesting = true;
       /* /* */ nesting = false; // */ 
       System.out.println(nesting);
    } 
 
16.  

Assume the variable declarations below for this problem:
 
int x = 3, y = 2, z = x + y;


Which of the following output statements correctly displays the sentence below?

3 + 2 = 5
 
	A. 	System.out.print(x + “+” + y + “=” + z);

 	B. 	System.out.print(x + “ + ” + y + “ = ” + z);       CORRECT
 
	C. 	System.out.print(x + y + “ = ” + z);
 
	D. 	System.out.print(x + y = z);
