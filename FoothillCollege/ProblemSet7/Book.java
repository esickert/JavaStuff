/*  This is the first of two classes. The book class creates a book with
/*  with 2 fields title and borrowed. Title is a String and borrowed is
/*  a boolean valuse. Various methods are used to set the title of an
/* object and whether the book is borrrowed or not. These methods and
/* fields are called in the library class when a book object is created.
